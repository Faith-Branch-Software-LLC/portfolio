<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Welcome! It may be that I only write to myself, or someone may take and interest in something I have to say. To you found your way here, I'm glad to have you.</p>
<p>I more or less just want to write about things I find interesting to get myself to do more creative writing. </p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Like I mentioned before, I want to write more, but there are a few more reasons than that.</p>
<ul>
<li>In college it would seriously take me multiple days for a 2 page paper. I don't want that to continue the rest of my life.</li>
<li>Practice typing. I can type fine, but I'd like to get better and faster and the main way to do that is to practice creative writing.</li>
<li>Talk about interesting things. Sure my business is in software, but there is so much more to life and I want to talk about it.</li>
<li>Get thoughts out of my head. I have been told by multiple people (and my wife multiple times), that I hold things in to much and that I need to express myself more.</li>
<li>In my mind, it makes prospect guests of the company feel like I am more approachable. They have the chance to hear my thoughts on different matters and maybe that little extra writing makes me seem more human.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My style</h2>
<p>I'm sure you've noticed the look of the website. You might describe it as unique or maybe even non-professional. It could be viewed as a business suicide from some view points. This doesn't bother me at all.</p>
<p>I'll go into more detail about the website styles in a different post, but the reason i bring this up is to say, I enjoy a bit of flavor in what I do. It's more exciting to make something fun and creative. Websites nowadays are all the same and lack personality. We need more applications like Duolingo that are unapologetically fun.</p>

<p>Everyone has preferences, so here are some of mine.</p>
